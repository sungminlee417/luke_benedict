      settings to soloistic performances. He is a commonly commissioned
      composer in the South Florida area, and has performed his own music
      across the United States both as a soloist, and as a part of the
      chamber group,‘The Muse Duo’, consisting of himself and classical
      guitarist Collin Holloway, touring locations such as New York, South

  - text: Luke combines the musical languages of the past and present to evoke
      several different idioms while still maintaining accessibility and
      originality. These languages range from the Baroque and Classical
      periods, to the more modern sensibilities of Rock, Serialism, and
      Minimalism. Rhythmic drive is also a prominent force in his works
      and takes center stage alongside unique and coloristic
      instrumentation, pointed motivic direction, and memorable melodic
      content. Alongside maintaining accessibility for audiences, a
      primary motivation of his compositional process lies in the
      enjoyment of the performers who present his works. Not only does
      Luke facilitate a musical experience that will appeal to a variety
      of audiences, but he also ensures his music will be gratifying for
      the performer to execute.
