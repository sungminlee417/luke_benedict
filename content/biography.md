  - text: "attended Eastman School of Music and Boston Conservatory of Music, where
      he studied under Rebecca Penneys and Michael Lewin in piano performance.
      He also earned degrees in music composition at Lynn University under the
      tutelage of Thomas McKinley. As a pianist, Luke has had a variety of
      experiences ranging from orchestral and chamber settings to soloistic
      performances. He is a commonly commissioned composer in the South Florida
      area, and has performed and toured his own music across the United States
      both as a soloist, and as a part of a chamber group consisting of himself
      and classical guitarist Collin Holloway, in ‘The Muse Duo’. "
  - text: "\tLuke combines the musical languages of the past and present to evoke
      several idioms while still maintaining clarity and accessibility. These
      languages range from the Baroque and Classical periods, to the more modern
      sensibilities of Rock, Serialism, and Minimalism. While rhythmic drive is
      a prominent force in his works, it is still paired alongside unique and
      coloristic instrumentation, pointed motivic direction, and memorable
      melodic content, ensuring an artistic voice that is entirely his own.  "
  - text: A focus on collaborative efforts is also a central component of Luke’s
      artistic vision. Recently, his music was featured as a part of Oklahoma
      City University’s 2023 Guitar Festival featuring ‘The Muse Duo’ and guitar
      orchestra in the work ‘from the floor’, a world premiere where he was both
      a soloist and the composer of the work. In 2024, he premiered his work
      ‘Grafico de la Petenera’, a vocal composition based on the poetry by
      Garcia Lorca, written specifically for ‘The Muse Duo’ and soprano Sydney
      Carbo. In both of these ensembles, Luke explores the idiosyncratic nature
      of the guitar and piano chamber ensemble both as a player and as a
      composer, while working to emphasize the talents of the performers his
      music is written for.
  - text: "His works are composed for a variety of unique settings. The piece ‘Work:
      for Harpsichord and mixed ensemble’ was premiered at a church during St.
      Mary’s Baroque Candlelight Series in the summer of 2023. As a part of
      ‘LOOP Art Critique’, his music was included as a part of a public art
      gallery, ‘Composers in the Metaverse’, that accented experimental
      exhibitions in an online environment. Completed by ‘The Muse Duo’,
      ‘Experiments’, released in the summer of 2023, is an album in which the
      entire track list is composed entirely of Luke’s original compositions.
      All of these different artistic avenues express Luke’s compositional
      language in different ways, and work towards making him a multi-faceted
      musician built for the modern age of classical music. "
